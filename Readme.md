# Site Deployment on GCP using Jenkins CI/CD

[![Create Sonarqube Docker Workflow](https://github.com/preciso-in/gha-sonarqube-docker/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/preciso-in/gha-sonarqube-docker/actions/workflows/main.yml)

- Terraform IaC configuration to deploy GCP resources

- Jenkins for CI/CD,

- Sonarqube for Quality Scanning before Docker deploys site.

## Setup, Deployment & Cleanup

Instructions folder contain instructions to Setup, Deploy and Cleanup Resources used in this project.

All 3 activities are executed using bash scripts that call Terraform CLI with required inputs.

## Best Practices Used

- IAC (Terraform) used to create GCP resources.
- GCP VM instances are preconfigured with Jenkins, Sonarqube and Docker using Startup scripts hosted in GCP Cloud Storage
- Individual scripts to Create, Destroy and Update limit user interaction to supplying Project_ID and bucket_id and region.
- Git Commits are required to map to a story-id.
- GCP VMs are created on pre-emptible spot instances to keep GCP billing charges to a minimum.

## Terraform vs. gcloud CLI in Bash Scripts: A Clear Advantage

### Conciseness and Maintainability

- Effortlessly replaced over 400 lines of intricate shell scripting with a remarkably concise and maintainable Terraform configuration. This streamlining translates to significant time savings in both initial setup and ongoing management.

### Declarative Nature Streamlines Execution

- Eliminated the need for meticulous debugging and command ordering, which were previously required with manual gcloud interactions. Terraform's declarative approach ensures accurate execution by intelligently determining the optimal sequence of actions, freeing up valuable time and reducing the risk of errors.

## Deployment choices made to minimise GCP Costs

Spot VMs with life of only 2 hours are used to deploy Jenkins, Sonarqube and Docker.

These VMs are Spot Preemptible instances. However, they will incur charges.

Rest of the resources created like startup scripts stored on GCP are negligible in cost. Hence, you can keep them.

However, project created will be counted against your Projects quota and billing quota.
Hence, it is advisable to delete these when no longer required using instructions listed in ./instructions/cleanup-instructions.md
